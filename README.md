## üîß Usage
You can use this project in three ways: Web UI, CLI, or as a Python module.

### 1) Web UI (Flask)
Run the web app and use a browser to download a CSV.
```sh
python app.py
```
Then open http://localhost:3000 and:
- Paste a Booking.com search URL (e.g., a page listing hotels for a destination/date range)
- Enter a filename (without .csv)
- Click ‚ÄúScrape & Download CSV‚Äù

Or use the hosted link above.

### 2) Command Line (interactive)
Run the script and follow the prompts.
```sh
python web_scrape.py
```
You will be asked for:
- URL: a Booking.com search results page URL
- File name: base name for the CSV

The CSV (e.g., my-hotels.csv) will be saved in the current directory.

### 3) As a Python module
Use functions directly in your own code.
```python
from web_scrape import web_scraper, fetch_html, parse_hotels

# High-level: fetch, parse, and write CSV. Returns number of rows.
row_count = web_scraper(
    "https://www.booking.com/searchresults.html?ss=auckland",
    "my-hotels",
)
print(f"Exported {row_count} rows.")

# Lower-level: fetch and parse without writing a file
html = fetch_html("https://www.booking.com/searchresults.html?ss=auckland")
rows = parse_hotels(html)
# rows is a list of dicts with keys: Hotel Name, Location, Price, Rating, Score, Review, Link
```

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Output
- A CSV file is created with columns: Hotel Name, Location, Price, Rating, Score, Review, Link.
- File is saved as <filename>.csv in the current directory.

## ‚ùó Notes & Troubleshooting
- Booking.com may change its HTML structure; scraping may need maintenance.
- If requests fail with HTTP errors, try again later or adjust headers/network. Basic browser-like headers are already included.
- Ensure lxml is installed (installed via requirements.txt) for faster/more reliable parsing.
- Use responsibly and review the website‚Äôs terms of service before scraping.
